# Brand-preferences

## Objective
To predict which brand of computers (Acer or Sony) Blackwell’s Electronics customers prefer using the responses of the survey questions to help the sales team decide with which manufacturer should pursue a deeper strategic relationship.

## Summary
The data from the completed survey was used to build a model to predict the customer brand preference of the incompleted survey. The selected model is a Random Forest that takes into account the age and salary of the customers with accuracy of 0.91 and kappa of 0.82. With this model, the customer brand preference for the incomplete survey was predicted.
### Conclusions
The brand preferences for the incomplete survey are predicted with great confidence, and this data can be used for the further analysis that was previously aimed.
### Suggestions
Two suggestions to the sales team of Blackwell's Electronics:
1. Because this data is not the representation of the real proportion in the different age and salary groups of Blackwell's Electronics clientelle, is a stratified sample, to decide which brand they should pursue a relationship, this data must be supplemented with the real representation of Blackwell’s population.
2. The used model takes into account very well defined groups of age and salary and their brand preference. Different marketing campaigns targeting each group with their preferred brand should be performed.
